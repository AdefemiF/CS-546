          <h2>Lost in Time</h2>
          <p>Aiden had worked it out after a few hours. He&apos;d arrived in the midst of nowhere, transported back in time. He had no idea how or when he had arrived. He hadn&apos;t consumed any alcohol or drugs, and the only thing he&apos;d had was coffee. Perhaps he had wandered from the bunker to the woodland near Owl Motel because he was terribly sleep deprived. The hotel, oh, the motel, where he&apos;d lost so much data. Despite the fact that he had never returned to the motel to see what had happened to it, his data and critical knowledge had been lost forever.</p>
            <p>Aiden had worked it out after a few hours. He&apos;d arrived in the midst of nowhere, transported back in time. He had no idea how or when he had arrived. He hadn&apos;t consumed any alcohol or drugs, and the only thing he&apos;d had was coffee. Perhaps he had wandered from the bunker to the woodland near Owl Motel because he was terribly sleep deprived. The hotel, oh, the motel, where he&apos;d lost so much data. Despite the fact that he had never returned to the motel to see what had happened to it, his data and critical knowledge had been lost forever.</p>
            <p>By the time he found a road to catch a train back to the shelter, numerous individuals were rushing and sobbing uncontrollably.</p>
            <p>"News 12 reporting that the Owl Hotel had become the scene of a gunfight...."</p>
            <p>"The filthy building has been shot up by gangs!"</p>
            <p>"MY BABY IS UP THERE, AND THE COPS WONT LET ME IN!"</p>
            <p>There are so many victims, as well as blown-up automobiles.</p>
            <p>Remebering this, Aiden couldn&apos;t help but recall the &quot;event.&quot; He had never thought of anyone else as important as himself at the moment. Grief, loss, and vengeance are all part of his story. The universe had revolved around him and his vengeance for him. Everyone else was either an ally whose sole purpose was to assist him in locating those who had carried out the hit.</p>
