        <p>So you wanna know where I went to school, huh? Let's get into it!</p>
      
        <section>
          <h2>CornerStone Christian School</h2>
          <p> My favorite Class at cornerstone, was the music class! I loved playing the recorder because it led to me playing the flute, which led to the drums, and now I'm a music producer!
        </p>
        <aside>One of my favorite memories was going to the liberty science center! It was so cool being able to see all the new technologies and seeing the IMAX theater!</aside>

        <section>
            <h2>Parsons Elementary School</h2>
            <p> My favorite class here was 100% band! I loved being able to play instruments as it was the one thing I felt like I was really good at.
          </p>
          <aside>Can't remember too much but I remember making TieDie Shirts for our yearly fun day! That was super fun and I still remember it so vividly!</aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Linwood Middle School</h2>
            <p> My favorite class here was 100% band. I got to play the drums and it's where I learned to play the drumset!
          </p>
          <aside> One of my favorite memories was our send off when I was in the 8th grade. It was crazy to see all my friends have fun together at night!</aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>North Brunswick TownShip High School</h2>
            <p> Favorite class had to have been percussion ensemble. It's where I learned to hone in my drum skills and where I joined the school drumline for competitions!
          </p>
          <aside> I think my send off in the day before we graduated was my favorite memory. Seeing everyone happy and smilin was a sight I'll never forget, especially now that we're all adults.</aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
            <p> My favorite class at stevens? Barely any but I'd probably say Failure. Yes, there's a class on Failure at stevens, ironic right?
          </p>
          <aside>Favorite memories were made during the summer of 2018 during the STEP program. It was absolutely the most fun I've ever had in a single summer!</aside>
