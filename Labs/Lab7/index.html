          <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
          <p>I was born in Lagos, Nigeria on June 27th 2000! I eventually moved to the USA when I was around 1-2 years old. <br> 
            My family all arrived in NJ and I've been here for the past 20 years. I was a very troublesome kid and was very energetic so I would love to do everything. <br> 
            My family would always tell me about how hyper I was and how I would get into trouble from doing so. Anyways, I got into video games at a young age and fell in love with it. <br> 
            That eventually led me to find my love of programming in High school and I was able to pursue programming in college as well! <br> 
            Through that, I was able to also find new hobbies such as music production and UI design (which i gave up on), so I'm hoping to be able to use this in the future! <br>
